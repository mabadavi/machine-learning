      "According to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article \"\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger\"\" is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.\"\n",

When I have insane nationalists blaming an entire ethnic group with inherited sin and racially abusing me by declaring me a non-native of where I was fucking born and bought up, then I start to wonder why I should care in the first place. But if anything, the article should focus on the cultural exchange between the English and Welsh, if this makes any sense - how each others culture has influenced the other, i.e. loan words, trade, traditions etc, whatever - anything to do with culture (I live in Devon. Some of our traditions and place-names are of \"\"West Welsh\"\" Celtic origins, most of us probably have Celtic DNA but we are most certainly not Welsh or Celtic! And don't get me started on that \"\"DEWNANS\"\" crap). It shouldn't be some political ethnic relations piece. I have no idea who put that lead sentence in, but they are clearly a smiling Welsh or English person, sitting in a cafe (or an English \"\"footy\"\" pub) right now drinking coffee that has been spat in by someone with an ethnic chip on their shoulder. I've met plenty of nice, decent, honest Welsh people - but the die-hard ethno cultural nationalist ones? I've met Irish Republicans, Scottish nationalists...and I find them more agreeable and less inclined to automatic hatred once they know my stance on things, but when it comes to general views of the English from the Welsh side of the nationalist coin...oh by. It's a 1500-year-old blood feud. As for how the worst of the English view the Welsh - it's usually just stereotype mockery or snobbishness, and it's very effing common. Off-hand racist remarks are something I have seen directed towards the Welsh on an almost weekly basis if I accidentally come into contact with the muppets who espouse it (TV, Forums, general street banter).

      "  It actually doesn't matter how good the information itself is, because even good information on Wikipedia cannot be trusted and therefore is not helpful. Anyway, it's well known that science coverage is better than humanities. The problem with situation like this is that you have people who seen to operate from a scientific mindset editing articles that have to do with literature, theology, culture, and philosophy. Most wikipedia admins mis-apply scientific concepts and criteria and methods to articles that are not subject to those methods. For instance, you constantly see idiotic admins asking for \"\"reliable\"\" \"\"empirical\"\" sources for a claim about literature, or asking for \"\"reliable\"\" \"\"unbiased\"\" citations for some postmodern topic. Hahaha. Anyway for philosophy at least we have the stanford encyclopedia. Right now the best compendium of information for information about the contents of books is on Amazon. Too bad that a greedy corporation gets to own and capitalize on all that free information. Wikipedia can't handle that stuff because any books that aren't the taste of these Richard Dawkinite Asperberger I-Fucking-Love-Science types get deleted. Like the Law of One article. Some pointy headed basement nerd decides he doesn't like those books so they should be deleted. Nevermind that they meet all the wikipedia requirements... what counts is that the admin thinks the books are \"\"nonsense\"\" and that the 30+ notable and reliable sources are \"\"biased\"\". And you can't get justice because there are way more dumb admins than good ones, and what kind of person would volunteer for such a terrible job anyway? The only people who become admins are power tripping losers with small man syndrome, because those are the only kind of people who benefit from the job. They don't follow the rules as laid out in wikipedia guidelines and there is no court or system to keep them accountable. The admin rot goes all the way to the top, and admins will never justify their rulings according to policy. It's like having a legal system where judges are not required to explain a ruling in legal terms. They just hand out the ruling without explaining how the ruling follows from law, and then they cry about it when people point out that there is no logical way to get from the written laws to the stupid ruling they made. They cry harassment. They delete your criticisms from their page. They delete the evidence you present. You claim this asshole is competent; why did he selectively delete the evidence I presented on his talk page? He deleted the EVIDENCE. That's not incompetence, that's malicious, that's psychopathic. Anyway now that this last article of mine is finally dead I can move on. I'd have to be an idiot to put any more of my work at the mercy of capricious, vindictive, arbitrary petty tyrants like that guy.   \"\n",
